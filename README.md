Graceful degradation is a design philosophy where a site maintains basic functionality, albeit with reduced features, when certain technologies fail. Service workers supports this philosophy by enabling web pages to load locally cached data when a request for data that is already stored on your browser is requested; this can allow sites to display information that was loaded before a wifi outage occured, for instance, or load elements of the page on slow mobile data connections. Without service workers, in these scenarios, the page might just entirely fail to load.
